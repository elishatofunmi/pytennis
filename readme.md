###  Discrete mathematics approach

This uses the y = mx + c approach to forecast new ball locations

Below shows, Agent A, predicting coordinate (x1, y1) - (300, 100) from its present point (x2, y2)-(450, 600)

Below shows, Agent B, predicting coordinate (x1, y1) - (200, 600) from its present point (x2, y2) - (214, 100)
